libbs2b (3.1.0+dfsg-2.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Use dh-autoreconf to update autotools stuff for new ports (Closes: #702090,
    #727396).
  * Apply patch from Andrew Gainer over at ubuntu to make autoreconf actually
    work.
  * Apply "format security" warning/error fix from Ilya Barygin. I don't think
    it will actually cause a security issue in this context and i'm not sure if
    it will cause a FTBFS in debian (apparently it didn't back in 2011) but it's 
    certainly horrible coding practice to pass a string that is not explicitly
    intended to be a format string to the first parameter of a printf so may
    as well fix it. (Closes: #646327)
  * Remove config.log manually in clean target, it doesn't seem to get removed
    automatically in all situations (in particular it was left behind when
    retrying a build after configure failed).
